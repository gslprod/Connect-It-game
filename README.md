# Connect It!

## Short description

**This is my final graduation project.**

This repo contains source files for mobile game "ConnectIt!".

I create it in order to test my skills on:

- Designing an object-oriented game architecture.
- Using Design Patterns and SOLID principles.
- Using Dependency Injection (Zenject Framework).
- Writing clean (readable and maintainable) code.
- Using some plugins: DoTween, UIToolkit, SimpleLocalization (partially).
- Using MV* Patterns.

Project lifecycle:
- Start: March 16, 2023
- Deadline: May-June, 2023

**Project is still on development. When the game is ready, I'll release it on [GameJolt](https://gamejolt.com/@GSL_Production).**
